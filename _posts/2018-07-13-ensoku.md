We had our field trip (遠足) on a Friday in June. I had been thinking of starting a vlog, so I thought I would start by making a video of this experience.

From Amazon, I bought a gimbal for my phone, a microphone, and an attachment that I can put on the gimbal to hold the microphone. I also bought neutral density filters from Yodobashi Camera because I had no control of my phone's aperture.

I originally intended to take statements from the other students, but the way my phone was setup on the gimbal didn't leave enough room to connect the mic to my phone. Also forgot to remove the ND filter when the room got dark.

I brought two other cameras with me. Barely used one, and didn't even take the other out of my bag. Taking videos takes up quite a lot of one's attention.

It took me two days to edit the video. I showed it to my teachers. They liked it; showed it to other school staff. They told me the people in charge of publicity/marketing liked the video, and asked me if it would be alright with me if they uploaded the video to Facebook and YouTube. (The video above was uploaded under the ISI Language School account.) I agreed without really asking for acknowledgment or pay because I felt the content was bland. It wasn't something I would want to include in my YouTube Channel.

We went to the Ninjutsu Village 忍術村, Nagahama Black Wall Square 長浜黒壁スクエア, and Nagahama Castle 長浜城. It was mostly just sight-seeing. Once we got to a destination, there would be a group photo, and then we could go off on our own and just come back to the bus before it leaves.

There were some activities in the Ninjutsu Village, but there wasn't really enough time to go around the entire place and enjoy yourself, unless maybe you move quickly through everything. At the Black Wall Square, it was mostly shops. Only a few of us went to the nearby shrine. There was even less time to go around the castle grounds of Nakahama Castle because they were about to close.

There was nothing much to the field trip itself. It rained a bit now and then. It was hot and humid. The school istn't really very good at organizing events (and making them interesting). Anyway, we were still able to enjoy the company of friends, and see our teachers in a slightly different light.
