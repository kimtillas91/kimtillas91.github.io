## Public Transportation
Kyoto isn't as busy as Tokyo or Osaka, so trains and buses don't have as many trips. Intervals between trips are usually longer than 10 minutes, and sometimes that's what makes you're commute time longer. In the late evenings, there are even less trips per hour. When I was still working at an izakaya, it would take me about 35 minutes to go from my dorm to work by train, and roughly twice that on my way home using the same route.

There are only a few train lines in Kyoto. Buses tend to have a wider reach than trains. However, if you do intend to go to tourist spots around Kyoto, you can be sure that there is at least one train station or bus stop around the area.

Trains and buses seldom get crowded. When they do, it's usually because of tourists. I have been in one or two buses that couldn't take in any more passengers, usually after going through popular tourist spots.

### Trains
There are only a few train lines operating in Kyoto, making it much easier to navigate the train system.

The Keifuku trams have a fixed rate of 220円 per trip. You pay on the train, before exiting, unless you get off at the last station, in which payment would be at the station gates.

And of course there are JR lines, but they can only take you to very limited areas within Kyoto. My school and dorm are both near JR train stations, so commuting by train is really convenient. Other than commuting to and from school, the only other times I use the JR train lines are when I travel outside Kyoto.

There are also other private lines in Kyoto. Some of them may be cheaper than JR, but like JR, they can only take you to limited places around the prefecture.

### Buses
In Kyoto, buses with routes that go around Kyoto City have a fixed rate of 230円. There is also a bus route that is only 100円, though I've never had to use it, but often see it around town.

If there aren't any train stations nearby, there are most likely bus stops around. Bus stops also aren't too far from each other. Each route has several bus stops, and it's pretty rare to go 5minutes without stopping at a bus stop. There is some traffic around town, but it's not terrible.

I used to take the bus more often, but there have been a number of times when the bus arrives later or doesn't arrive at all (based on the printed schedule, and Google Maps).

There have also been some cases where there are several bus stops in an area, and I've had to go back and forth trying to figure out which bus stop the bus I wanted to get on was going to stop at.

### Commuter Pass (定期券)
You can purchase a commuter pass (teikiken) for the JR line, and for fixed-fare buses. The commuter pass comes as an ICOCA card with details of your pass (your name, route, the validity of your pass, etc.) printed on it. Because it's an ICOCA card, there's a 500円 deposit. If you already have an ICOCA card, you can use that for your commuter pass so you don't have to keep getting a new card.

For the JR line, the amout you pay for depends on your commute route, i.e. from what station to what station. For the bus commuter pass, the price depends on distance.

Aside from the commute route on your commuter pass, you can still use your commuter pass to travel outside your route. Say your commuter pass is only for station S1 to S4, but you're taking the train from S2 to S5, you will only be charged the fare from S4 to S5 (as if you took the train only from S4 to S5).

You can get your commuter pass from Kyoto station. There are also some JR stations with green ticket vending machines. You can purchase commuter passes from there.

Ask your school if they can give you a student commuter pass, as it is cheaper than regular commuter passes.

## Bicycles
The cheapest way to get around Kyoto is by bike. Especially if you're planning to stay long-term. If you're lucky, you can buy a second-hand bike for less than 10,000円 from Sayonara Sales, but do make sure to get proper registration. Bike theft does happen in Japan, so getting the proper papers from your seller ensures that what you're buying isn't stolen property. And if your bike does happen to get stolen, the police can easily identify your bike and help you find it.

I decided against buying a bicycle because I was only supposed to study in Kyoto from October to March, and I didn't want to ride a bicycle out in the cold. It hardly snowed this year (and it doesn't snow that much in Kyoto city), so that's something you don't have to worry much about if you're thinking about buying a bike.

There's a free bike parking right outside [my school]({% post_url 2018-01-12-studying-in-japanese-in-kyoto-part-2-isi-kyoto %}){:target="_blank"} and that could have saved me a lot of money. And speaking of parking, be mindful of places where you can and can't park your bicycle. There are usually spaces in front of stores (especially convenience stores and supermarkets) where you can park your bike. You can also look for bicycle parking signs (駐輪場).

Also be mindful of where you can and can't ride your bike. There are some sidewalks where you can't ride your bike.

## Taxis and... Uber?
Buses and trains only operate up to a certain time, so if you're out until 1a.m. and you don't have a bike, you either have to wait until the trains and buses are back in operation (which is around 5a.m.), or you can take a taxi, or an Uber.

Taxis throughout Japan are expensive. I mostly see taxis pass along major roads, so hailing a taxi from a residential area away from main roads is probably going to be challenging. If you have Internet connection, you can hail taxis through apps. You can also call taxi companies by phone to come and pick you up.

One of my housemates usually uses Uber when he comes home in the early mornings. He says it's cheaper than taxis.
