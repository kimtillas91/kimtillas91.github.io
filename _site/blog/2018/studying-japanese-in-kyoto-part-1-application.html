          <p>I’ve been studying Japanese in Kyoto since October, and I’ve been meaning to write about the process because when I was looking into studying at a language school in Japan, I just couldn’t seem to find enough resources online, and that made me feel really anxious.</p>

<p>I’m going to write about this topic in three parts: the first being about applications; the second about my school and school life; and the third, a review of the school.</p>

<p>I first considered studying at a Japanese language school in Japan when my girlfriend’s friend started going to one herself. At that time I was back in the Philippines taking Japanese lessons every Saturday, but was feeling largely unsatisfied with the pace of the lessons (which is not to say that I was the most diligent student, because I wasn’t). Going to class only once a week, it was hard for me to retain all the vocabulary and kanji we learned in class. I felt that if I wanted to become fluent in Japanese, I had to put myself in a situation where I would always encounter the language and be forced to think and communicate in that language.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3>Primary Research</h3>
<p>My girlfriend’s friend made her application via an organization called Jellyfish Education, which she complained about, so I didn’t consider approaching them (but in retrospect maybe I should have). It’s not that it’s a bogus organization, but I didn’t bother looking into her complaints.</p>

<p>I started looking at Japanese language schools on the Internet, and then I found <a href="https://gogonihon.com/en/" target="_blank" class="external">Go! Go! Nihon</a>, which is a free service that helps foreigners study Japanese in Japan. They had a list of language schools on their website, rating each school by the level of difficulty of the school’s approach to teaching Japanese. They also have information about tuition fees, facilities, and other points with which you can compare one school with another. I was able to choose which school I was most interested in, and filled up a form on the website.</p>

<p>In choosing your school (or if you really want to study at a Japanese language school in Japan), I highly suggest looking into how classes are conducted, what to expect from the school, and what the school expects from its students. You don’t want to waste money on a school only to find out that it doesn’t fit your learning style. Keep in mind also the culture of education in Japan. Some people get frustrated with school and end up having an unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>Applications for Japanese language schools generally start about than six months before your entry month. The specific documents you will need for your application should be on the school’s website, but the most notable requirement, I think, is money. You should be able to prove to the school that you have enough money to pay for your school as well as living expenses during your stay. If you don’t personally have that amount of money, you should have a sponsor who is willing to support you financially during your study.</p>

<h3>Direct Application</h3>
<p>You don’t actually need an organization to help you with your application to the school, although they can make it a little more convenient. Because that’s what they do.</p>

<p>Anyway, there was a misunderstanding in my email correspondence with Go! Go! Nihon, so instead of pointing that out right away, I just tried directly applying to the school that I initially wanted to apply to.</p>

<p>Things were going great. I was able to submit the requirements, and then it was time to pay for the application fee. My bank was asking for an invoice or some proof of the reason for the transaction because of whatever policy they have, so I tried sending the money via Western Union instead as it seemed less of a hassle to do. Turns out the transaction failed, so I ran back into Go! Go! Nihon’s open arms and here I am now.</p>

<h3>Go! Go! Nihon</h3>
<p>The people you talk to on Go! Go! Nihon were or still are language school students, so they know what people have to go through to study Japanese in Japan. The thing is, they make mistakes, too. When they do, just send them back an email and clarify things. They’re nice people and will own up to their mistakes.</p>

<p>Applying through Go! Go! Nihon also has perks, like special discounts and access to a community of fellow Japanese language learners.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Process</h3>
<ol>
	<li>[<strong><span style="color: #339966;">APPLICANT</span></strong>] Submit requirements and pay application fee.</li>
	<li>[<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">SCHOOL</span></strong>] Approve your application and submit to Japanese Immigration.</li>
	<li>[<strong>JPN IMMIGRATION</strong>] Issue Certificate of Eligibility.</li>
	<li>[<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">SCHOOL</span></strong>] Issue invoice for tuition and other fees.</li>
	<li>[<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>APPLICANT</strong></span>] Pay fees.</li>
	<li>[<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>SCHOOL</strong></span>] Send you your Certificate of Eligibility (CoE).</li>
	<li>[<strong><span style="color: #339966;">APPLICANT</span></strong>] Apply for Visa</li>
</ol>
<p>After the school submits your application to Immigration, you will have to wait about a month for news if your CoE was granted or not. You will know the results about a month before school starts. Depending on your school, you may have to pay for your school fees before they mail you your CoE.</p>

<p>In my case, I had to pay for the first 6 months of school, and the first 3 months rent for the dorm. After the school confirmed receipt of my payment, they sent my CoE within 48hrs.</p>

<p>Once you receive your CoE, start applying for your visa. In the Philippines, language school students need to apply for their visa via an accredited travel agency listed in the Japan Embassy’s website. I was able to get mine in less than a week.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>Do be careful in choosing which language school to enroll in. There are some <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/03/national/social-issues/experts-warn-japans-language-schools-are-becoming-a-front-for-importing-cheap-labor/" target="_blank" class="external">shady language schools</a> out there that exploit the influx of foreigners coming to Japan to learn Japanese.</p>
