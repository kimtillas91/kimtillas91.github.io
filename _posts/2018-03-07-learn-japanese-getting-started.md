Back in highschool, almost all my friends loved anime. I didn't watch as much as they did, but I started getting hooked and watched mostly what my friends also watched.

In anime, they make Japanese sound really cool (I'm not a fan of dubbing). If you watch anime often, you pick up words and phrases and feel like you're slowly starting to learn the language. And so you think, why not learn Nihongo?

## Nihongo 日本語
To start, I think it would be helpful to paint a picture of Japanese (from here on I shall refer to as 'Nihongo') as a language.

### Grammatical Structure
The basic word order of English is **SVO**. This means that the **Subject** comes first, then the **Verb**, then the **Object** of the Verb. For Nihongo, however, it's **SOV**, so the **Verb** comes last. (And in my native language, Tagalog, it's **VSO**.)

I'm bilingual, fluent in two languages with different structures, but I still found it difficult to learn and get used to the word order of Nihongo. It takes a lot of getting used to, but if you practice thinking in the language you are learning as often as you can, constructing your own sentences, you will eventually get used to it.

In a way, thinking in Japanese is like staging a play. Set the stage and placing the actors and objects, and then giving the actors direction.

### Writing System
Nihongo uses three sets of characters:
- Hiragana (ひらがな)
- Katakana (カタカナ)
- Kanji (漢字)

Kanji are characters borrowed from the Chinese, some of which were made in Japan. Hiragana and Katakana are also based on Kanji, each character representing a single syllable.

When you start studying Nihongo, the most important to learn is Hiragana. There are several Hiragana charts you can scour on the Internet. I suggest learning the proper stroke order as well. It can help make your writing more legible, as well as recognize other fonts and hand-writing. Once you've learned Hiragana, as much as possible, try not to write Nihongo in Romaji (Roman characters).

Katakana is typically used for words borrowed from other languages, and onomatopoeia. After learning Hiragana, Katakana should be easy. (Hiragana and Katakana are collectively called "Kana".)

As for Kanji, if you're still starting out, it's something you can learn as you go along. If there are words you are particularly interested, you can look up the Kanji on your own. You can also look for resources with a suggested sequence of Kanji for you to learn.

## Resources
The resources below are meant as supplementary materials. I can't really recommend any one book or app as your main resource for self-studying Nihongo.

### Books
While studying Basic Nihongo, I was able to use two different books: Genki and Minna no Nihongo.

The first time I studied Nihongo in a Japanese Language School at my hometown, we used [Minna no Nihongo](http://amzn.to/2tr1iMG){:target="_blank" class="external"}. In another school (not a language school), we used Genki. Personally, I didn't like Genki. I felt it was too...talkative, with longer-than-necessary explanations in English that I didn't find particularly helpful, and not nearly enough example sentences.

Here in Japan, our language school also uses [Minna no Nihongo](http://amzn.to/2FpEaiM){:target="_blank" class="external"} for its Basic Level Academic course.

To get yourself accustomed to the language, practice the grammar and vocabulary you've learned, and eaven learn how to construct better sentences, I suggest reading [Tadoku Books](http://amzn.to/2G5cfpO){:target="_blank" class="external"}. The point of Tadoku is to read a lot. You can start with familiar stories translated to Nihongo to get accustomed to narrative styles in Nihongo.

### YouTube Videos / Channels
#### Nihongo Dekimasu
You can find playlists for Nihongo Dekimasu on YouTube. The series follows an exchange student as she learns to use different grammar patterns with the help of an anthropomorphized duck, and a robot.

#### Nihongo de Kurasou
Nihongo de Kurasou also shows different situations where you can use different grammar patterns, but is geared towards adults.

#### Japanese from Zero / Japanese in 5
Japanese from Zero and Japanese in 5 are both from the same YouTuber, George. He's an American who went to Japan as a teenager (if I'm not mistaken), worked as a translator/interpreter, and now teaches Nihongo in America. He has his own website that also has a community of Nihongo learners. He also wrote a series of books.
