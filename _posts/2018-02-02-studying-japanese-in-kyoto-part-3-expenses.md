One of the most important things to consider when planning your language study in a foreign country is **living expenses**. Language schools typically give a rough figure of how much you will need monthly. In Kyoto, they typically say **JPY 100k per month**. That includes rent, food, and transportation.

I'm going to show you a break down of my expenses on my first 3 months in Kyoto so you can see for yourself how much you might actually need if you do decide to study here.

### Rent
#### JPY 45,000
As I've mentioned in [Studying Japanese in Kyoto - Part II]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-12-studying-in-japanese-in-kyoto-part-2-isi-kyoto %}), I'm currently staying at one of the school's dormitories. Rent is relatively cheap. (At this time it's JPY44,300 a month, but will increase by JPY2000 come April.) The rent includes WiFi, utilities, toilet paper, dish-washing liquid, kitchen sponges. (I will write more about this in a later post. You can also find a brief post I wrote about the dorm [here](https://kimtomwrites.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/this-blog-this-dorm/){:target="_blank" class="external"})

### Food and Drinks
#### JPY 17,000
It's worth noting here that I'm very small and I'm not a very heavy eater, so while JPY 17,000 may be enough for me, it might not be enough for others.

On school days, I usually have lunch at school. There's a cafe on the first floor with student-friendly prices. (Although they increased the prices of most of the items on the menu by JPY20-30 at the start of the year.) I usually spend around JPY250-400 per meal. I was also sick for about 2 weeks and bought hot drinks from the vending machine everyday for those 2 weeks.

The school has a drinking water dispenser, so sometimes I just bring a bottle and get water from there.

You can also save more if you cook your own meals. Of the JPY17,000 I spend on food and drinks, roughly JPY10,000 goes to groceries. That usually includes meat and vegetables, sometimes fruits and chips, and a few beers now and then.

Rice is expensive in Japan (compared to the Philippines and, according to my friend, Russia). At the supermarket, a 2-kg bag of rice is roughly JPY900. I was able to make a 2-kg bag of rice last for more than a month, but if you love your rice you will probably spend more for your daily rice intake.

If you don't/can't cook, you can save money by looking out for discounted items in convenience stores and supermarkets. Some items will have a sticker with these characters 半額 (はんがく), which means it's at half price. You might also see stickers with 割引 (わりびき) on it, which means it's discounted. Supermarkets usually have cooked food at half the price 1-2 hours before closing time.

Pharmacies also sell food. There are some items that seem to be always on sale, such as granola and instant noodles. If you plan on hoarding (which you don't really have to because these items are always on sale), do check the signs on display. There are some items which you can only buy a certain number of for the discounted price to apply.

Prices with yellow background are usually discounted prices.

### Transportation
#### JPY 12,000
I usually take the train to school. It costs JPY 190. Students in our school aren't elligible to get a student commuter pass, unfortunately. I thought that meant we couldn't get a commuter pass at all, so that's why my monthly transportation costs around this much. If you get a commuter pass, you can bring down the cost a little more.

Once in a while I also go out with friends, but we try to walk as much as we can just so we don't spend too much.

If you're staying long, you can also buy a bike to save on transportation. There are second-hand bike shops, and you can also check **sayonara** (yes, usually spelled without the 'u') **sales**. Just make sure the bike you buy has registration papers that come with it.

### Cellphone Service
#### JPY 4,500
I actually bought this SIM card while onboard Jetstar Japan. I'm on a 7GB data plan with unlimited calls and texts to phones on the same service. The SIM card itself was JPY 500 (it was on promo at Jetstar) and the service is JPY 4,500 monthly. You can actually find cheaper service providers.

If you intend to work part-time while you study, you will likely need a Japanese phone number.

If you're staying for a short period of time, you can probably get by without mobile data. Convenience stores offer free WiFi, and they are very easy to find.

### Laundry
#### JPY 1,200
Our dorm has a coin-operated washer and dryer. The washer is JPY 200 per use. The dryer is JPY 100 per 30 minutes. Laundry soap plus fabric conditioner will probably be around JPY 800, but that should be good enough for 3 months.

### Toiletries
#### ???
I actually brought enough shampoo, conditioner, body soap, facial wash, toner, sanitary napkins, deodorant, and toothpaste from the Philippines and I still haven't run out, so I can't say how much this would cost if you bought all these here.

### Others
#### JPY 4,000 - 11,000
Aside from those listed above, I've also had to buy some clothes for winter and dining things. I've also spent some money for leisurely activities. These usually amount to a few thousand yen a month, so it's wise to also set aside some money in case you may need to buy or pay for some things.

Also, if you're staying more than 3 months, you may have to get national health insurance, which (right now) is at JPY 1,700 monthly.

Almost everything in Japan is expensive, and I think people from most countries will agree on this. If you are on student visa, you are actually allowed to work up to 28 hours a week (40 hours during term breaks) part-time. Unfortunately, here in Kyoto, it takes some luck to find a good job, and working 28 hours a week on top of school isn't as easy as it may seem.

In the future I will write more about my experiences with part-time work (アルバイト).
