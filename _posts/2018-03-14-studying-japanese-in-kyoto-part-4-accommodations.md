After finally securing your application to a language school, you now have to think about accommodations. If you applied to a language school via a service such as [Go! Go! Nihon](https://gogonihon.com/en/){:target="_blank" class="external"}, they usually help you find accommodations. Your options usually include dormitories, apartments, sharehouses, and homestays. If you applied directly to a school, they would also likely help you find a place. After all, they sponsored your visa, so they are in some way responsible for you. You can also look for a place on your own via the Internet.

Something you may want to consider is that whenever you rent, there are usually one-time fees you have to pay which can't be refunded. So if you want to save some money, it's best not to keep moving around. Also, everytime you change your address, you will have to go to the ward office (区役所) to have your Residence Card updated.

### Dormitories
Dormitories are relatively more affordable than others, but they aren't all cheap. The dormitory I stayed at (around Arashiyama) increased the fees by 2,000円 last January, and will be increasing the rent by another 2,000円 next month. The increase in price brings it close to the amount I am paying now to stay at a sharehouse, in which I now have a room of my own.

The design, management and maintenance of dormitories varies. In the case of my dormitory, everyone staying there is from the same school. Each room has two tenants. Boys stay on the first floor; girls on the second floor. The management provides tissue, cleaning materials, cooking utensils (pots, pans, knives, chopping boards). Someone also comes in thrice a week to clean the common areas. You have to pay to use the washing machine and clothes dryer. The showers and toilets are shared (one shower room and one room for toilets per floor). The kitchen is shared.

Probably the worst part of staying in such a dorm is having to stay with people who aren't mature enough to live in a space where they have to share with other people. Some of the people in my dorm don't wash the dishes and utensils they used. They leave the kitchen messy almost every night. There was also someone who got one of the toilets clogged and didn't bother telling the management (or at least the school) about it, so it took maybe a week before we could use that toilet again. And most recently, someone supposedly took a dump in the shower and left it there. (I didn't actually see the poop, but the management posted a sign on the shower room door asking to not take a dump in the showers — they are very passive-aggressive when dealing with the tenants.)

On the other hand, there are some dorms wherein you already have a kitchen and bathroom in your room. These are likely more expensive. Some dorms aren't necessarily affiliated with or owned by schools.

### Apartments
In Japan, an apartment is usually called a "mansion". Apartments come in different shapes and sizes. A common acronym you might see while searching for a place to rent is "LDK", which stands for Living, Dining, Kitchen. There is usually a number in front of it, which indicates the number of bedrooms there are. You can [read more about layouts here](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/what-do-japanese-apartment-layout-terms-mean/){:target="_blank" class="external"}.

Of the people I know renting apartments, only one of them is lives by herself. It's much more affordable if you can split rent with friends (if you happen to be coming to Japan with any).

One more thing is that some apartments don't provide Internet connection, so you would have to get it yourself.

### ShareHouses
Sharehouses are typically slightly more expensive than dormitories. Most would probably be around 60,000円 a month including utilities and WiFi. Sharehouses are also popular among Japanese people, so there's a good chance that you will be able to live with Japanese people and maybe, if your schedules align, be able to interact with them and even make friends.

There are some sharehouses that regulate how many foreigners and locals can stay in the sharehouse at a time. That's actually how it is here where I am staying now. They also have a lot of other perks that you can [check on their website](https://www.borderless-house.com/){:target="_blank" class="external"}. They also offer a discount for students!

In comparison with the dorm, though, you typically have more responsibilities in a sharehouse. Everyone is expected to pitch in with chores. Some sharehouses do have someone come in maybe once a week to clean up some of the common areas. One such sharehouse is [Raku Arashi (楽嵐)](https://kansai.hituji.jp/comret/info/kyoto/kyoto/rakuran/special/2515){:target="_blank" class="external"}. It's owned by a really nice couple, and because it isn't owned by a group or company, you can negotiate with the owners if the price is too expensive. It's an all-girl sharehouse, each room having it's own theme. There's also a TV inside each room, so if you're a very private person, this might be a good choice for you.

### AirBnb
I found out from one of my friends that it is possible to rent long-term through AirBNB. The good thing about AirBNB is that you don't have to pay for the usual one-time fees when renting a dorm, apartment, or sharehouse. As far as I've searched, the price of the AirBNB doesn't stray so far from the price of other accommodation types. However, you do have more limited options.

If you aren't satisfied with the available accommodation options, you can temporarily stay at an AirBNB while searching or waiting for something better. For most accommodations, only a 1-month advance notice is necessary before moving out, so by the time you arrive in Japan, there might be more options available to you.

### Homestay
The most expensive option is the homestay. I'm not so sure about arrangements with homestays, like how long you can stay with one family and things like that.

[Borderless House](https://www.borderless-house.com/program/homestay/){:target="_blank" class="external"} actually has a short (3 days, 2 nights) homestay program if it's something you really want to experience.
