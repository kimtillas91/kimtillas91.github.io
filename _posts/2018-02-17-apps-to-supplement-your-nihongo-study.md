Before coming to Japan, I had already studied Nihongo for over two years, albeit intermittently. I first studied at a language school in the Philippines, took 9 units of Japanese Language in college, and then took Saturday classes when I was already working.

Because I wasn't studying Nihongo continuously, I forgot a lot of the things I learned. When I was enrolling for the Saturday Nihongo classes, I had to take a level test, which I tried to cram for. I was evaluated to be one level lower than what I could have gotten if I had prepared for the exam. So much of my first days in class were a lessons I had already taken in college. The same thing happened when I came to Japan.

When learning a language, exposure to the language is very important. Even now that I'm in Japan, I still look for ways I can supplement my language study. One of the things I turn to is technology; specifically, mobile and web applications.

## Dictionaries 辞書
The dictionaries listed below are English-Japanese dictionaries, but when you're past N4 level, I recommend getting a Japanese-only dictionary. I haven't exactly found one that I recommend yet, though.

### [imiwa?](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imiwa/id288499125?mt=8){:target="_blank" class="external"} (iOS)
Back when I was using an iPhone, this was my dictionary of choice. So far, I haven't seen a dictionary app that can compare in terms of functionality, usability, and visual design.

It has definitions available in **English**, **French**, **Russian**, and **German**. You can search in any of the mentioned languages, or in Japanese, romaji or otherwise. Aside form definitions, it also shows example sentences. Like most dictionary apps, you can search for Kanji by radical.

_I haven't used this app in years, so I may not know or remember some other useful features._

### [Takaboto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.takoboto&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"} (Android)
Takaboto is probably the closest dictionary app to _imiwa?_ that I've tried using on Android. It also has **some** translations in French, German, and Russian. You can also search in Japanese or otherwise. There are also example sentences for **some** words, although the example sentences don't always show a variety of ways to use a particular word. The UI and Kanji search feature can definitely be improved though.

What I like about Takaboto is how it displays the Kanji's stroke order. It shows the series of strokes at a glance and indicates at which point each stroke starts. You can also save words to [AnkiDroid](#ankidroid) to make your own deck, or add your own translation of a word (or phrase) in any language.

### [Jsho](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ric.Jsho&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"} (Android)
Unlike _imiwa?_ and _Takaboto_, Jsho doesn't support languages other than English, nor does it display example sentences. You also have to toggle between English and Japanese when making a search.

What I do like about Jsho is that it stores your recent searches. There have been many times that I've used this feature, and it does save time, especially when I search for Kanji which I don't know the reading of. Because it's designed to be light-weight, it's easier to see information at a glance. I tend to have more taps on _Takaboto_, unless I have to keep switching between English and Japanese.

I also found it easier to search for Kanji by radical using Jsho, but I'm not sure if it's just because I've been using it longer than _Takaboto_.

In terms of definitions, Takaboto and Jsho both use Jisho.org's engine, so you're going to see the same translations in both apps.

### [Jisho.org](http://jisho.org/){:target="_blank" class="external"}
I've been using Jisho.org since I started formally studying Japanese. It now has a feature where you can draw the Kanji you want to search instead of just using radicals. It can also use voice input, though I haven't tried using it yet.

Aside from vocabulary, Jisho.org also has a database of common Japanese names, so if you don't know how to read someone's name, you can look it up here.

## Translator
### [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/){:target="_blank" class="external"}
When pressed for time or simply overwhelmed by unfamiliar Kanji or vocabulary, Google translate can be helpful. While not exactly accurate, it can be a starting point to translate text.

It's feature to translate text on an image can also save a lot of time.

## Gamified study tools
These apps don't particularly make learning Japanese any more fun, but they do come in handy when you have down time and you have nothing but your smartphone with you.

### [Kanji Senpai](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.rodriguez.kanjisenpai.android&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"}
While it's name just says "Kanji", it's really more of a vocabulary tool.

> Kanji Senpai will help you learn Japanese vocabulary and kanji.
By using a spaced repetition system (SRS) you can memorize the different aspects of each vocabulary: meaning, pronunciation, reading, listening, writing, etc.

You can choose from a vocabulary list, categorized by JLPT level. Each vocabulary will have the Kanji, kana, and English or Spanish translation. If you purchase a premium list, it will also include audio pronounciations and the hand-writing feature. The audio and hand-writing features also come with the free lists, but are very limited.

I found this useful in learning Kanji, but got bored with it after using it almost daily for about a month.

Aside from using this app, I suggest looking for example sentences as well, so that when a word comes up, you can think of a simple sentence to use it in.

### [AnkiDroid](){:target="_blank" class="external"}
Like _Kanji Senpai_, this app also uses spaced repetition. However, this app is more of a self-assessment tool, whereas _Kanji Senpai_ is time-pressured.

With AnkiDroid, you can make your own deck of 'flashcards', or download someone else's. You can add images, notes, what-have-you.

### [Obenkyo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Obenkyo&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"}
Obenkyo is sort of like a textbook turned into an app. It has grammar explanations, vocabulary and kanji lists, kana stroke order. It also has tests for kana, numbers, kanji, vocabulary, and particles.

The UI can definitely be improved, but it is a very useful app to learn or review Nihongo.

## Social Media
While there are apps that help you retain information about grammar and vocabulary, the best way to practice a language is to use it to communicate with other people.

### [HelloTalk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hellotalk&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"}
HelloTalk is a social media platform for language learners. You can post "moments" with text and/or images; you can chat with or follow other people on HelloTalk.

The app has translation and transliteration features. It can read out a body of text. It also allows you to mark a post as favorite, or correct someone's spelling/grammar.

## Reading / News
### [NHK News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clem.nhkradio&hl=en){:target="_blank" class="external"}
Reading news in simple Japanese not only keeps you informed about current events, but also expands your vocabulary, and familiarizes you with how to go about expressing information.

After every article, there is a vocabulary list with descriptions in Japanese. There are also select vocabulary that you can click on to show a translation (English, Chinese, Korean). There's also an audio reading of the article, and you can select the play speed. You can also play radio news on this app.
