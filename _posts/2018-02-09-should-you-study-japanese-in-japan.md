I've been studying Nihongo in Kyoto for about four months now, and throughout those four months I've had a lot of time to think about my decision to come here to study the language. I've made friends with different backgrounds and goals, and have recently had conversations with them about our current situation, studying Japanese in Japan.

When you go to a language school in Japan, you assume that everyone who goes there is there because they **want** to study Japanese. I think it's unlikely that anyone here was forced to be here.

Before coming to Japan, I had this image, this expectation of what living in Japan would be like. It's not that reality is actually so far from this expectation, but I did feel, almost immediately, disillusioned.

That shouldn't stop you from wanting to live and/or study in Japan, though. In fact, disillusionment would probably be good for you. It may not feel good at first, but it's something you should come to terms with, and you shouldn't let it stop you from accomplishing what you came to do here.

### Why study Japanese in Japan?
There are most likely Japanese language schools in your country as well, perhaps with the same intensity and methods as language schools here. So why come all the way here and spend so much to study Japanese?

#### Exposure to the language and the culture
A few years ago, I went to Seoul with my girlfriend. Months before our flight, I tried learning the Korean writing system. I didn't exactly put a lot of effort into it, so of course I was only really able to retain information partially. But a few days into our stay, because I always tried to read the signs (and my girlfriend was always there to correct me) I was able to learn the writing system and actually retain the information.

Before I even thought about studying Japanese here, I had already been taking Japanese classes almost every Saturday. I also had a day job at that time, and I found it difficult to keep motivated to study, and to make myself be exposed to the language more.

The first time I studied Japanese was at a Japanese language school in my hometown. In that language school, our teacher would, as much as possible, only use Nihongo while teaching. I found it to be very effective. I wanted that same experience, and take it to the next level. And here I am now.

When you come to Japan to study, you can't not be exposed to the language and the culture. While there have been efforts to make Japan more foreigner-friendly, most people still prefer to speak in Japanese, and not all signs and public announcements have English translations.

There are also situations where you have to speak in Japanese, no matter how bad you are at it. And if you make the most of your stay, you can immerse yourself in activities and situations that can enrich your experience.

Since language and culture are very much intertwined, being immersed in the culture helps rewire your brain to think in the language you are learning.

There's also a great sense of accomplishment when you start understanding things you encounter everyday, such as shop signs and announcements on public transport.

#### Travel around the country
During your free time, you can definitely go sight-seeing. If you have the money, you can take the Shinkansen and see other parts of the country. If not, you can still visit nearby prefectures.

#### Make international friends
Each language school has different demographics. Some schools have a lot of diversity, others tend to cater to a certain group of countries.

[My school](http://www.isi-education.com/location/kyoto/){:target="_blank" class="external"} has a relatively large population of Chinese and Vietnamese students, but there are also a number of students from the Middle East and other Asian countries, Europe, and the Americas. _(I'm not entirely sure about the entire student body at this time. This is only from my observation.)_

You also have the opportunity to make friends with Japanese people. I don't exactly have a Japanese friend yet, but some of the people I work with at my part-time job have been really friendly.

### Is it worth it to study Japanese in Japan?
Studying in Japan can be very expensive. Aside from school fees, there's rent, transportation, health insurance, and food, among other things.

If you have (or your sponsor has) the money for it, if you get in a good school with good teachers, and if you make the most of your stay, I'd say that it is very much worth it.

If money is going to be difficult, maybe consider other options. You may be able to work part-time in Japan, but you can't be certain that you can immediately find a good job. In most cases, working part-time pays around JPY800 - JPY1,000 per hour. And if you plan on going to Japan with zero to little knowledge in Japanese, it's going to be even harder to find a job.

If you can already have daily conversations in Japanese (JLPT N3), you will have more options in terms of the types of jobs that qualify for. It will also be easier to get a job wherein you can practice your Japanese.

If you really want to study Japanese in Japan but don't have enough for an entire term (which is usually three months long), you can go on a study trip instead.
