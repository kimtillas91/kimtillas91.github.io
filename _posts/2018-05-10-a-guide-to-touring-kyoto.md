Filipinos usually allot only a few days for travelling (because we don't want to use up all our paid vacation leaves in one go). When we do travel, especially abroad, we want to make the most of it, i.e., doing as much sight-seeing as you possibly can. To do that, it's best to have an itinerary. Not necessarily something you need to follow down to the letter, but at least something to refer to so you know where to go and how to get there (and if you're on a budget, how much it would cost).

If you're making your own itinerary, here are a few points I advise you to consider:
<!--more-->
### 1. Transportation in Kyoto has its limitations

The trains can only take you to limited places, and the intervals between trips are usually longer than 10 minutes. Getting day passes for trains also doesn't seem to be worth it as they won't be able to take you to all the tourist spots anyway.

Buses are a better way to get around and tour the city. As far as I know, every popular tourist spot in Kyoto has a nearby bus stop. Taking the bus can also be cheaper than taking the train. Buses that go around within Kyoto City (not the entire prefecture) have a fixed price of JPY230 (JPY120 for kids). A day pass as of posting is JPY600 (used to be just JPY500).

However, just like trains, intervals between bus trips can take longer than 10 minutes. But there are usually more than one bus route you can take to go from point A to point B. The downside of taking the bus, though, is that sometimes they arrive late or not at all, and you have no way of knowing.

### 2. Most tourist spots involve a lot of walking or hiking

Sight-seeing in Kyoto is mostly walking around and taking in the surroundings. If you're not used to walking, you might have to take breaks now and then, which you might want to consider in planning your itinerary.

### 3. Most toursit spots close by 5PM

This is what I found to be most challenging when I plan itineraries for people I show around Kyoto. Aside from the time it takes to walk to/around tourist spots, and the not-so-frequent bus trips, that most tourist spots close by 5PM (some even earlier) makes it harder to fit more places to visit in one day.

If you're visiting mid-Autumn or during Sakura season, there might be some tourist spots with Illumination events that will allow you to visit at night.

### 4. Tourists everywhere

Typical tourist destinations start getting crowded from 10AM. Crowds usually gather by the entrance, mostly because they're excited to take pictures and selfies.

## Where to go, What to see

If you want to visit as many (popular tourist) places as you can within two or three days (one day is really not enough), the best way to go about it is to divide the city into three: west, center, and east. In this way, you don't spend too much time going from one place to another.

I've listed the popular places to visit and a couple not-so-popular places as well. You can visit 2 places in the morning; another 1 or 2 after lunch, before 5PM; and at night, if you're into it, you can go to Shijo, or Gion.

### West Kyoto

- Arashiyama Bamboo Forest
- Arashiyama Monkey Park
- Toei Kyoto Studio Park

![Kyoto City - West]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kyoto-west.jpg "Kyoto Map: West"){:class="post-img"}

#### Arashiyama Bamboo Forest
The Arashiyama Bamboo Forest doesn't have an opening or closing time (and admission is free), so this is a good place to start (or end) your day. You can avoid a huge crowd if you come before 10AM or after 4PM.

{% include flickralbum.html albumhash="72157661159765997" %}

The Bamboo Forest branches into different paths. There are temples nearby. There is also a path that can take you to **Katsura River**, across which is the Arashiyama Monkey Park.

#### Arashiyama Monkey Park
Open from 9AM - 4PM. Admission is JPY550.

{% include flickrphoto.html pturl="27143359127/in/dateposted-public/" %}

It's a (roughly) 20-minute hike to get to the monkeys. Along the path, there are some trivia about the macaque monkeys.

#### Toei Kyoto Studio Park
Open from 9AM - 5PM. Admission is JPY2,200 for adults; some attractions cost additional fees.

{% include insta.html instahash="Bhiw8-BB1xt" %}

The Toei Kyoto Studio Park is a film set and theme park that recreates the Edo Period. There are some shows you can watch for free. There are also some actors roaming around the park with whom you can take pictures with.

### Center Kyoto

- Nijo Castle
- Kyoto International Manga Museum
- Imperial Palace
- Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)

![Kyoto City - Center]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kyoto-center.jpg "Kyoto Map: Center"){:class="post-img"}

#### Nijo Castle
Open from 8:45AM - 5PM, but admission is only up to 4PM.

{% include insta.html instahash="BfGLdFJnzJH" %}

{% include insta.html instahash="BilXpRehSUZ" %}

#### Kyoto International Manga Museum
Open from 10AM - 6PM, entry up to 5:30PM. Closed on Wednesdays. Admission is JPY800.

There's a library of manga inside. Before the entrance there's a shop for merch.

#### Imperial Palace
Open from 9AM ~ 4PM. Closed on Mondays. There may be additional days when they are closed. Admission is free.

{% include insta.html instahash="9fFUAZj72j" %}

The Kyoto Imperial Park is really, really spacious. Aside from the Imperial Palace, there is another palace inside the park. If it happens that you visit the Imperial Park on a day (or time) when the Palace itself is closed, there will still be a lot for you to see.

#### Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)
Open from 9AM - 5PM. Admission is JPY400.

{% include insta.html instahash="BiluKBGBa03" %}

The best way to get here is by bus, as there are no train stations nearby. Do prepare yourself to ride a crowded bus.

### East Kyoto

- Fushimi-inari
- Kiyomizu-dera
- Ginkaku-ji  (Silver Pavilion)

![Kyoto City - East]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kyoto-east.jpg "Kyoto Map: East"){:class="post-img"}

#### Fushimi-inari
Fushimi-inari, like Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, also has no opening or closing hours and no admission fees.

{% include insta.html instahash="BbBL6ReHSxo" %}

It gets really crowded in the first two sets of torii (the red Shinto shrine archways), but the deeper you go into the mountain, the less crowded it gets, the less people you will be in the way of while you're taking pictures, and vice-versa.

{% include insta.html instahash="BbEwU-cH5Vw" %}

You don't have to hike all the way to the top, especially if you're following a schedule. There isn't much to see up there. Personally, it didn't feel as rewarding as I thought it would (but I did enjoy the time I spent with my friends getting there).

Fushimi-inari is along the JR Nara Line, so if you're planning to go to Uji and/or Nara as well, you might want to take this into consideration.

#### Kiyomizu-dera
Open from 6AM - 6PM. There is a part of Kiyomizu-dera that has an entrance fee of JPY400.

{% include insta.html instahash="BgqyKlaHKpq" %}

To get to Kiyomizu-dera, you will have to walk up a hill lined with souvenir shops.

#### Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion)
Open from 8:30AM ~ 4:30PM. Admission is JPY500.

I found Ginkaku-ji to be more memorable than Kinkaku-ji.

## Navigation

**Google Maps** is a good-enough app to use for navigation around Kyoto, but it's not always accurate. Sometimes it pins a bus stop at the center of an intersection. But, if you can't read Japanese, Google Maps is very helpful.

If you can read Japanese, **Y! MAP** is more accurate and has more detailed information (and has a sorting criterion for cheapest path).

If you're taking the bus, make sure you're on the right side of the road. The Japanese are usually very helpful. If you don't want to bother someone randomly on the street, you can ask the bus driver if you're getting on the right bus.
