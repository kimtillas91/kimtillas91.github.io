Living in Japan, even as a student, is quite expensive. Prices of goods and services are relatively expensive, even with discounts for food and transportation.

Even before coming to Kyoto, I was already looking for part-time work I could start applying for. I didn't anticipate, though, how difficult it would be to find a job that would also allow me to practice Japanese with the level I was at (N4). Most jobs where you get to be exposed to language require at least N3 (daily conversation) level. Even English-teaching jobs are difficult to find for non-Native speakers.

When I arrived in Kyoto, my school had only been operating for 3 months, so during my first term, the available jobs posted on our bulletin board were more of factory work and cleaning jobs. And although I was fine with that kind of work, .the hiring organization that was working with the school never got back to me about the jobs.

So I looked for other means to find jobs. My sister's friend introduced me to her friend, who introduced me to another friend who got me an interview at the restaurant she worked at. Unfortunately I failed that interview because half-way into the interview, I choked because my interviewer started using words I wasn't yet familiar with. I also found a [website for connecting language learners to teachers](https://hello-sensei.com/en/sensei){:target="_blank" class="external"}, but no one ever contacted me.

I then started seeing ads on Facebook for services that help foreigners find work in Japan. I first tried [FindWorks](https://findworks.jp/){:target="_blank" class="external"} and they introduced me to what would be my first part-time job. It was a popular izakaya chain. I passed the interview, but because I was too focused on just getting employed, I didn't think carefully about the conditions that would eventually be part of the reasons why I quit that job.

Before I get to why I quit, I also want to express my frustration in the application process. After passing the interview, I was asked to submit some documents (from my school and the ward office) which cost me a significant amount of money---maybe a few hundred to a thousand yen. After submitting the documents, I had to wait for the regional office to deliver the shoes that was part of our uniform, and that took about a month. During that waiting period, the good people from FindWorks kept asking for updates about my application, so I had to keep calling the izakaya/regional office for updates. And for someone who doesn't like making phone calls, having to make phone calls in a language you're still just learning caused a lot of anxiety.

What really pushed me to quit was the branch manager. It's not that he would embarass me in front of other people, but he made me feel like my inadequacies were all completely my fault, even though the training they gave me wasn't nearly sufficient. It was also in the way he talked down on me, and how unreasonable he was. (I called in sick and he told me to go all the way to the izakaya to have the assistant manager "confirm" that I was sick, instead of just having me call the assistant manager instead. It was winter.) And every time I had work, I always felt a creeping anxiety before my shift started, which I suspect was because of the branch manager.

But aside from how terrible I felt about the branch manager, two other major problems I had with the job were:
1. **I couldn't work as much as I wanted to.** My manager would only give me very limited working hours per week. Sometimes just one 4-hour shift a week.
2. **I wasn't allowed to work outside the group of companies the izakaya belonged to.** So I basically wasn't allowed to find another work to compensate for the measley number of hours I was being given. (I didn't want to work for other restaurants under the same company because of my experience with them.)

I didn't have trouble quitting, though. It took maybe just a minute for me to tell the branch manager about it, and he was pretty satisfied with my reason for quitting being school-related. (He wasn't really a bad person, just didn't have the type of leadership I agree with.)

The group of companies required a specific bank in which they would deposit the salary, but I wasn't able to open an account at that bank because they have a requirement where you have to have already lived in Japan for 6 months before you could open an account with them. During my interview, they told me that I had to go all the way to the regional office in Osaka to get my salary, but a couple of weeks after my last day, the branch manager told me to come to the izakaya to come and get my salary.

The school has also recently been in contact with more establishments, so there are more options for employment. It was the school that introduced me to my current job, also a restaurant. My boss is great; she's like a mom. And the people leading don't expect you to know everything. If they know you aren't ready to do something, they won't force you, but they will encourage and push you to take more and more responsibility until you get used to the work. I also had to come in late one day (because I was moving out and my schedule got pushed back by two hours) and my boss was very understanding about it.

Sometimes my working days change though, like if someone asks to have their schedule changed and my boss has to re-adjust other people's schedules as well, because you can't have too many or too few on staff. But I still get at at least 20 hours a week.

Both my part-time jobs were at restaurants and it's been a real eye-opener to be in the service industry. During peak hours it gets really tiring. Even a four-hour shift can be exhausting, whether you're just washing dishes, or preparing food, or serving customers. It always feels good when a customer is polite, and more so when they express their appreciation for your service.
