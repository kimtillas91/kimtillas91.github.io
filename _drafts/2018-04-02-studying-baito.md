Before coming to Kyoto, while I was still looking into studying Japanese in Japan, I had already started looking into whether or not salary from part-time work would be enough to cover living expenses in Japan. On a student visa, you are only allowed to work 28 hours a week (40 hourson school break). In Kyoto, the minimum wage is 831 yen per hour. On minimum wage, it is possible to earn up to 90,000 yen in a month, assuming you work 28 hours a week. If you live frugally, 90,000 yen should be enough to cover rent and other living expenses. (I wrote about my [monthly living expenses]() in a previous post.)

In my experience though, it took me a while before I could get a job, and my first job, I felt, wasted time I could have spent looking for another, much better job.
