          <p><a href="http://www.isi-education.com/" target="_blank" class="external">ISI Language School</a> has campuses in Tokyo (Ikebukuro and Takedanobaba), Nagano, and Kyoto. The Kyoto campus just opened July 2017, and I started going there in October of the same year.</p>

<h3>Courses</h3>
<p>At ISI, you can choose the course best suits your needs. In the Kyoto campus, as far as I know, there are two courses available: General and Academic.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In the <strong>General Course</strong>, the school plans cultural and tourist-y activities for the students as much as three times (if I’m not mistaken) every week. Classes are held in the morning, activities in the afternoon. Students are placed in different levels from Beginner to Intermediate. The screening criteria for placement aren’t as strict as in the Academic Course.</p>

<p>I’m not very familiar with the structure of the classes, but they are at a much slower pace than the academic course. Some of the students I met from the Basic level academic course said that they weren’t being taught grammar.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Academic Course</strong>, which I am taking, are divided into three levels, subdivided into another two. These levels are Beginner (初級) I and II, Intermediate (中級) I and II, and Advanced (上級) I and II.</p>

<p>In Beginner I, almost all chapters in the Minna no Nihongo I textbook are covered. The coverage for Beginner II includes the last chapter/s in Minna no Nihongo that weren’t covered in Beginner I, plus most chapters of Minna no Nihongo II. (We were able to finish up to Chapter 46.) I didn’t take JLPT N5, but finishing Minna no Nihongo I should be enough to get you through N5; Minna no Nihongo II should be enough for N4.</p>

<p>In Intermediate I, after finishing Minna no Nihongo II, there is about a week or two of brushing up on nuances in the usage of particles, a few N3-level grammar, and then the curriculum jumps straight to N2 grammar. As far as I know, the school doesn’t really bother with N3. As to why, I’m not sure. The Kanji book we are using now is also for JLPT N2 preparation.</p>

<h3>Schedule (Academic Course)</h3>
<p>Beginner and Intermediate I classes are held in the afternoon, while Intermediate II and Advanced classes are held in the morning. I started at Beginner II. Everyday we learn six new Kanji, which we have to memorize for a 10-item multiple choice test the following day. Every two days we learn a new chapter from Minna no Nihongo, grammar and vocabulary; and every couple of weeks we have a long test about the grammar and vocabulary from three chapters of the book. Everyday, we have homework. We spend 3.5 hours in class, with three 10-minute breaks every 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Our class had three different teachers, each assigned 1-2 days a week for our class. So for Mondays we had Teacher A; Tuesdays and Fridays Teacher B; and Wednesdays and Thursdays, Teacher C. In the Beginner I class, I think they had a different teacher for each day of the week.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>The school helps you get a name stamp (判子 or 印鑑), open a bank account, and maybe find a part-time job (though perhaps not the one you’re looking for, if you’re picky). You can ask your teachers for help with things like filling out forms, how to go to a certain place, how to get a commuter pass (<strong>NOTE</strong>: You can’t get a STUDENT commuter pass as an ISI Language School student), etc.</p>
<h3>Dormitories</h3>
<p>ISI Kyoto has three dormitories. Two of them are in Arashiyama; one is in Kameoka. I don’t think the dorms are actually owned by ISI. It seems to me they are only partnered with housing companies that own and manage these dorms. That said, there are teachers assigned to coordinate with these companies, so that if you do have concerns, you can approach the teacher in charge.</p>

<p>(I have more to say about the dormitories, which I will write in a separate blog post.)</p>

<hr />

<p> 
The General Course is more expensive than the Academic Course. Some students transferred from General Course to Academic Course because they wanted to learn the language more in depth. The school doesn’t give refunds, so it would be best to think about which course best suits your objectives. Hopefully this helps you make that choice!</p>
