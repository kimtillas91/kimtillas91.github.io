Kyoto is a city that brings in a lot of tourists. According to [Study Kyoto](https://www.studykyoto.jp/en/whykyoto/){:target="_blank" class="external"}, 1 of every 10 people in Kyoto is a university student. That said, one would expect the city to have convenient modes of transportation.

## Public Transportation
Kyoto isn't as busy as Tokyo or Osaka, so trains and buses don't have as many trips. Intervals between trips are usually longer than 10 minutes, and sometimes that's what makes you're commute time longer. When I was still working at Karasuma, it would take me about 20minutes to go to work by train, and roughly twice that on my way home using the same route.

If you intend to go to tourist spots around Kyoto, you can be sure that there is at least one train station or bus stop around the area.

### Trains
There are only a few train lines operating in Kyoto, so compared with Tokyo, it's much easier to navigate the train system.

The Keifuku trams have a fixed rate of 220円 per trip. You pay on the train, before exiting, but if you get off at the last station, payment will be at the station gates.

### Buses
In Kyoto, several bus routes have a fixed rate of 230円. There is also a bus route that is only 100円. I've never had to use it, but often see it around Shijo.

### Commuter Pass (定期券)
You can purchase a commuter pass for the JR line, and for fixed-fare buses. 


## Bicycles
The cheapest way to get around Kyoto is by bike. Especially if you're planning to stay long-term. If you're lucky, you can buy a second-hand bike for less than 10,000円, but do make sure to get proper registration. Bike theft does happen in Japan, so getting the proper papers from your seller ensures that what you're buying isn't stolen property.

I decided against buying a bicycle because I was only supposed to study in Kyoto from October to March, and I didn't want to stay out in the cold. It hardly snowed this year (and it doesn't snow that much in Kyoto), so that's something you don't have to worry much about if you're thinking about buying a bike.

There's a free bike parking right outside [my school]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-12-studying-in-japanese-in-kyoto-part-2-isi-kyoto %}){:target="_blank"} and that could have saved me a lot of money. And speaking of parking, be mindful of places where you can and can't park your bicycle. There are usually spaces in front of stores (especially convenience stores and supermarkets) where you can park your bike. There are also a few sidewalks where you can't ride your bike.

## Taxis and... Uber?
