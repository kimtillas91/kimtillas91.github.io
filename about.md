<p>I learned to use Jekyll and Squarespace to create websites.</p>

<p>I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with specialization in Network Engineering at De La Salle University - Manila, during which time I was an active member of Malate Literary Folio, the university's official literature and visual arts publication, where I served as Editor-in-Chief for two consecutive years.</p>
